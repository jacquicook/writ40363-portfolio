   <h1>Professional Experience</h1>

   <section> 
    <p> At Potts Law Firm, I coordinated podcast episodes, vendor outreach, and event planning. My role at Stroll Magazines involved researching and writing feature articles while supporting client relationships. Both experiences strengthened my ability to manage deadlines and communicate effectively in professional settings.
   </p>

     </p> I also worked on social media tracking, marketing invoices, and client care, which taught me how to stay organized and detail-oriented. These roles gave me a strong foundation in balancing creativity with professionalism.
