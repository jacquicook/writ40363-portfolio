 <h2> About Me</h2>
   <p>  My name is Jacqui Cook, and I’m from Houston, Texas. I’m currently a senior at TCU majoring in Strategic Communication. I’ve moved around a lot because of my dad’s job, which has definitely shaped who I am. I was born in Melbourne, Australia, and since then I’ve lived in Houston, Malaysia, California, Fort Worth, and now I’m back in Houston again. Moving so often got me really interested in traveling and experiencing new places</p>
       <p> Last summer, I worked with East Shore Magazine, where I wrote feature articles, managed aspects of client care, and had the chance to connect with community members and business sponsors. This experience strengthened my writing skills and showed me how important relationship-building is in media.More recently, I interned at Potts Law Firm as a marketing intern. In this role, I worked on invoices, assisted with event planning, and supported a variety of marketing and communications tasks. This gave me hands-on experience in managing projects, staying organized, and seeing how communication plays a role in a professional services environment.</p>

    <h2> Goals</h2>

<HEAD></HEAD>
    <p> From Multimedia Authoring, I hope to learn the basics of coding and how to create projects that look professional and creative online. I’m interested in understanding how design choices, like layout and color, can affect how people view and interact with digital content.
</p>

<h2 id="skills">Skills &amp; Learning</h2>
<p>During my time as a Marketing Intern at a Houston law firm, I gained experience in social media management, event coordination, and client outreach, helping to strengthen the firm’s brand presence. I also worked with a magazine company, where I researched and wrote feature articles, assisted with photoshoots, and supported client care. These roles allowed me to develop strong communication, content creation, and relationship-building skills that translate across both corporate and creative industries.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background </h2>
<p>I attended Fort Worth Country Day School and am currently pursuing a degree in Strategic Communication with a minor in Digital Culture and Data Analytics at Texas Christian University. With a strong interest in marketing, public relations, and social media, I plan to build a career that combines creativity with strategy to help brands connect meaningfully with their audiences.</p>

<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>

    <p> In this class, I hope to become more comfortable using GitHub as a tool for collaboration and version control. I want to learn how to push and pull files, track changes in my projects, and organize my work in a way that feels professional. I also hope to get a better understanding of how GitHub is used in real-world jobs so I can apply these skills outside of the classroom.With VS Code, my goal is to build confidence in writing and editing code. I want to learn how to structure my projects correctly, use extensions to make coding easier, and troubleshoot errors on my own.
</p>

<p>I am <em>especially passionate</em> about digital media and communication.</p>
