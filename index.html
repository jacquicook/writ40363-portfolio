<p>After I graduate, I’m planning to backpack through Europe for two months, and I can’t wait to try new foods, meet people, and see different cultures up close.I’m also really into sports, especially tennis and pickleball. I love playing with friends and family because it’s a fun way to hang out while staying active. Whether it’s traveling or playing sports, I enjoy anything that lets me connect with people and try new things.

<h2> Current Learning</h2>
<p>: From Multimedia Authoring, I hope to learn the basics of coding and how to create projects that look professional and creative online. I’m interested in understanding how design choices, like layout and color, can affect how people view and interact with digital content.
