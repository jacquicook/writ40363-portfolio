      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a junior at Texas Christian University majoring in Strategic Communication with a minor in Digital Culture &amp; Data Analytics. My academic background combines communication strategy with digital media skills, giving me a strong foundation in both creative storytelling and analytical thinking.</p>
      <p>Outside of school and work, I’m passionate about social media, traveling, and exploring new cultures. Having moved around my whole life to many different countries, I’ve developed an open-minded perspective and a creative approach to problem-solving. These experiences inspire me to think globally and connect with diverse audiences—qualities I hope to bring into my future career in marketing, PR, or digital media.</p>
