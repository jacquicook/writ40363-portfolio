        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a junior at Texas Christian University majoring in Strategic
          Communication with a minor in Digital Culture &amp; Data Analytics.
          My academic background combines communication strategy with digital
          media skills, giving me a strong foundation in both creative
          storytelling and analytical thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of school and work, I’m passionate about social media,
          traveling, and exploring new cultures. Having moved around my whole
          life to many different countries, I’ve developed an open-minded
          perspective and a creative approach to problem-solving. These
          experiences inspire me to think globally and connect with diverse
          audiences—qualities I hope to bring into my future career in
          marketing, PR, or digital media.

              <p>
                For my Global Branding class, I created a market entry plan for
                Raising Cane’s expansion into the Netherlands. I analyzed
                cultural insights, consumer behaviors, and local competition to
                understand how American fast-food brands are perceived abroad.
                The project emphasized Dutch preferences for value-driven meals,
                halal options, and sustainable practices, leading to
                recommendations on how Cane’s could adapt its branding and menu
                to stand out in a competitive market.

              <p>
                For my research class, I worked with a team to analyze Liquid
                Death’s marketing strategy and consumer perceptions through 12
                in-depth interviews. Findings revealed strong appeal in the
                brand’s recyclable aluminum packaging and bold identity. Applied
                models such as SMCRE, AIDA, and SWOT to assess positioning among
                Gen Z, millennials, and health-conscious consumers, ultimately
                providing strategic recommendations for brand growth.
