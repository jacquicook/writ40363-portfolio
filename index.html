   <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>I am a junior at Texas Christian University majoring in Strategic Communication with a minor in Digital Culture & Data Analytics. My academic background combines communication strategy with digital media skills, giving me a strong foundation in both creative storytelling and analytical thinking.</p>
     <p>Outside of school and work, I’m passionate about social media, traveling, and exploring new cultures. Having moved around my whole life to many different countries, I’ve developed an open-minded perspective and a creative approach to problem-solving. These experiences inspire me to think globally and connect with diverse audiences which are qualities I hope to bring into my future career in marketing, PR, or digital media.</p>

The project emphasized Dutch preferences for value-driven meals, halal options, and sustainable practices, leading to recommendations on how Cane’s could adapt its branding and menu to stand out in a competitive market.</p>
