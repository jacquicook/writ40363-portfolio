# Project Zed: AI-Assisted Web Application

## Project Overview
Project Zed is an AI-assisted web application development project that explores the intersection of human creativity and artificial intelligence in web development. This project demonstrates the collaborative process between a developer and AI tools to create a functional, well-documented web application.

## Course Information
- **Course**: WRIT 40363 - Writing for Digital Media
- **Institution**: Texas Christian University
- **Semester**: Fall 2025

## Project Objectives
This project aims to:
1. Explore AI-assisted development workflows and their impact on the creative process
2. Document the collaboration between human intent and AI capability
3. Create a functional web application with modern web technologies
4. Reflect on the ethical, practical, and creative implications of AI in web development
5. Demonstrate proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- AI Development Tools (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.)

## Key Features
[To be documented as the project develops]

## Development Process
This project follows an iterative development approach, with careful documentation of:
- Design decisions and their rationale
- AI tool interactions and prompts
- Problem-solving approaches
- Code refactoring and optimization

## AI Collaboration
This project extensively utilizes AI tools to enhance the development process. All AI interactions are documented in `AI_COLLABORATION_LOG.md` to provide transparency and insight into the collaborative workflow.

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I aim to:
- Understand the capabilities and limitations of AI-assisted development
- Develop critical thinking about when and how to use AI tools effectively
- Practice clear communication with AI assistants to achieve desired outcomes
- Balance AI assistance with personal creativity and problem-solving

## Getting Started
[Instructions to be added for running the application locally]

## Future Enhancements
[Planned features and improvements to be documented]
