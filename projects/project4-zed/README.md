# Playlist Pulse – Project Zed: AI-Assisted Web Application

## Overview
Playlist Pulse is my Project Zed application: a Spotify-inspired music playlist manager where users can add songs, assign them to playlists, filter by genre, search by keywords, and view personalized recommendations based on their top genre.  

This project represents my attempt to “upskill” using AI, building beyond the difficulty level of Projects 1–3. AI tools (ChatGPT + Claude) helped me plan, debug, structure files, and understand more advanced JavaScript patterns such as event delegation, state management, and dynamic DOM rendering.

## Course Information
- **Course**: WRIT 40363 – Writing for Digital Media

## Project Objective
Project Zed focuses not only on building a working app but understanding **how** AI can elevate my development process. My goals were to:
- Use AI to support feature planning and debugging  
- Learn stronger front-end development skills  
- Apply advanced HTML/CSS/JS techniques  
- Document the full collaboration process transparently  
- Reflect meaningfully on AI’s impact on learning  

## Features
- Add songs with title, artist, album, playlist, genre, rating, and notes  
- Spotify-style dark theme (black + neon green)

- Modular, clean JS logic  

## Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (custom properties, grid, animations, responsive design)  
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+, DOM manipulation, event delegation, localStorage)  
- **AI Tools: ChatGPT + Claude**
